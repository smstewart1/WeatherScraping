# WeatherScraping
In this Coursera project, I build a Jupyter Notebook that scrapes the National Weather Service for weather alerts.  Both the BeautifulSoup (bs4) and Folium libraries were utilized. With this notebook, a user gets data for the 100 counties in North Carolina and a script extracts the weather alerts and plots a map of the different counties, their names, and a pop up of any weather alerts.  Counties with weather alerts are in red, while those without are in white.
